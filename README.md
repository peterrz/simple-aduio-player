# simple-audio-player
this program design for the specific reason it is a fork from: gist.github.com/jewelsea/1446612
# What is this player?
this player read all *.mp3 file in a directory and play them as a list
# How does it work?
user chose directory first then if directory had any *.mp3 files it played it otherwise send message no file to play.
